# EG
This is a sample to be used from within "udlist" (3.17 directory list) to call GOEDIT. However, it can be easily changed to use XOEDIT for any arbitrary single-byte EBCDIC code page, if XOEDIT is customized accordingly.

Notes...
- This simple version cannot handle files with single quotes in the name.
- The routine EG in the corresponding ZIP file should be placed into a PO data set like GOEDIT and XOEDIT.
